# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#
# Example:
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
#
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return i, j
        return -1, -1

# Run code:
s = Solution()
print(s.twoSum([5, 6, 7, 8], 15))
